# Default Course Enrollment Feature

## Overview

This feature automatically enrolls all users (existing and new) in the **JavaScript Fundamentals** course (`js-fundamentals-1`) by default. This ensures that every user has access to foundational JavaScript content as soon as they join the platform.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Database Script: `scripts/add-default-course.js`

This script handles enrolling all existing users in the default course.

**Features:**
- ✅ Enrolls all existing users in `js-fundamentals-1` course
- ✅ Skips users who are already enrolled (prevents duplicates)
- ✅ Creates enrollment records with `ACTIVE` status and 0% progress
- ✅ Supports all user roles (STUDENT, TRAINER, ADMIN)
- ✅ Creates activity logs for tracking
- ✅ Provides detailed console output with progress and summary

**Usage:**
```bash
# Direct execution
node scripts/add-default-course.js

# Using npm script
npm run db:default-course
```

**Sample Output:**
```
🚀 Starting default course enrollment script...
📚 Found course: "JavaScript Fundamentals" by Jane Instructor
📝 Course status: PUBLISHED
👥 Found 8 total users
✅ 1 users already enrolled
📋 7 users need to be enrolled:
   - Jane Instructor (instructor@example.com) [TRAINER]
   - John Smith (john.smith@example.com) [TRAINER]
   - Admin User (admin@example.com) [ADMIN]
   [... more users]

⏳ Creating enrollments...

```

### 2. Automatic Enrollment for New Users

Modified the signup API route (`src/app/api/auth/signup/route.ts`) to automatically enroll new users in the default course during registration.

**Features:**
- ✅ Automatically enrolls new users in `js-fundamentals-1` during signup
- ✅ Uses database transactions to ensure data consistency
- ✅ Graceful error handling (signup succeeds even if enrollment fails)
- ✅ Creates activity logs for tracking
- ✅ Only enrolls if the default course exists and is published

**Database Transaction Flow:**
1. Create new user account
2. Check if default course exists and is published
3. Create enrollment record for the default course
4. Create activity log entry
5. Return user data and authentication tokens

### 3. Course Information

**Default Course Details:**
- **ID:** `js-fundamentals-1`
- **Title:** "JavaScript Fundamentals"
- **Level:** BEGINNER
- **Price:** $79.99
- **Status:** PUBLISHED
- **Trainer:** Jane Instructor

### 4. Database Schema Impact

**Tables Modified:**
- `enrollments` - New enrollment records created
- `activity_logs` - Tracking entries for enrollment actions

**Enrollment Record Structure:**
```sql
{
  studentId: string,       -- User ID
  courseId: 'js-fundamentals-1',
  status: 'ACTIVE',
  progress: 0,            -- 0% initial progress
  enrolledAt: DateTime    -- Current timestamp
}
```

**Activity Log Structure:**
```sql
{
  userId: string,
  action: 'COURSE_ENROLLED',
  details: 'Automatically enrolled in default course: JavaScript Fundamentals',
  metadata: {
    courseId: 'js-fundamentals-1',
    courseTitle: 'JavaScript Fundamentals',
    enrollmentType: 'DEFAULT' | 'DEFAULT_ON_SIGNUP'
  }
}
```

### 5. Error Handling & Safety

**Safeguards Implemented:**
- ✅ Duplicate enrollment prevention
- ✅ Course existence validation
- ✅ Course published status check
- ✅ Database transaction rollback on errors
- ✅ Graceful fallback (signup continues even if enrollment fails)
- ✅ Comprehensive error logging

### 6. Verification Commands

**Check Enrollment Status:**
```sql
-- Check total enrollments for default course
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM enrollments WHERE courseId = 'js-fundamentals-1';

-- List all users enrolled in default course
SELECT u.name, u.email, u.role, e.enrolledAt 
FROM enrollments e 
JOIN users u ON e.studentId = u.id 
WHERE e.courseId = 'js-fundamentals-1';

-- Check activity logs
SELECT * FROM activity_logs 
WHERE action = 'COURSE_ENROLLED' 
AND details LIKE '%JavaScript Fundamentals%';
```

### 7. Future Considerations

**Possible Enhancements:**
- Configuration file for multiple default courses
- Admin UI for managing default courses
- Role-based default course assignment
- Opt-out mechanism for specific users
- Default course progression tracking

**Configuration Options (Future):**
```javascript
const DEFAULT_COURSES = {
  STUDENT: ['js-fundamentals-1'],
  TRAINER: ['js-fundamentals-1', 'instructor-training-1'],
  ADMIN: [] // No default courses for admins
}
```

## Testing the Feature

### Test New User Registration:
1. Create a new user account
2. Check that they are automatically enrolled in JavaScript Fundamentals
3. Verify they can access the course content
4. Check that activity log is created

### Test Existing User Enrollment:
1. Run the script: `npm run db:default-course`
2. Verify all users are enrolled
3. Check that no duplicate enrollments are created
4. Verify activity logs are created

### Verify in Learn Dashboard:
1. Login as any user
2. Navigate to `/learn`
3. Confirm "JavaScript Fundamentals" appears in enrolled courses
4. Click on the course to access content
